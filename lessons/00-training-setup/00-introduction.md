## Training Setup  

The training consists of a series of lessons delivered through Jupyter Notebooks.  

### Prerequisites  

We assume the following setup:  

- **Python and VSCode**  
  - Python 3.11 installed and running  
  - VSCode as the primary editor  
  - VSCode extensions for Python and Jupyter Notebook installed  

While other configurations are possible, we aim to standardize the training environment for consistency.  

Now, proceed with the individual lessons to ensure your system is properly set up for the training.
