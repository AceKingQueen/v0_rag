    "One way of abstracting this, is to use an *orchestration framework` such as *Langchain*. It is the initial framework that generated a lot of buzz. See <https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then other frameworks such as *LLamaIndex* <https://www.llamaindex.ai/> emerged. They have different philosophies but are often converging to the same functinoality.\n"

      "DevOps is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to improve collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. The goal of DevOps is to shorten the software development lifecycle, enhance the frequency of software releases, and improve the reliability of software applications. It achieves this through automation, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), and a focus on collaboration and shared responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key components and principles of DevOps include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Collaboration and Communication**: Breaking down silos between development and operations teams to foster better communication and cooperation, leading to faster problem-solving and innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Automation**: Implementing automated processes for testing, deployment, monitoring, and infrastructure management to reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and accelerate delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**: CI involves the practice of regularly integrating code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated testing. CD takes it further by automating the deployment of code to production, ensuring that software can be released confidently and frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through code and automation, which allows for consistent environments and simplifies infrastructure management.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Monitoring and Feedback**: Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure in production, gathering feedback from users, and using that information to improve future development and operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Cultural Transformation**: Emphasizing a culture of shared responsibility, trust, and learning, where teams can collaborate effectively and adapt to changes quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "By adopting DevOps practices, organizations can achieve faster deployment times, improved quality of software, and better alignment between business objectives and IT capabilities. This ultimately leads to higher customer satisfaction and a competitive advantage in the market.\n"
