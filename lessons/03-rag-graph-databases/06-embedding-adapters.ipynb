    "### **Why Do We Do This in the Model?**\n",
    "The function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def model(query_embedding, document_embedding, adaptor_matrix):\n",
    "    updated_query_embedding = torch.matmul(adaptor_matrix, query_embedding)\n",
    "    return torch.cosine_similarity(updated_query_embedding, document_embedding, dim=0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**performs two key operations**:\n",
    "1. **Transforms the `query_embedding` using the `adaptor_matrix`**\n",
    "2. **Computes cosine similarity between the transformed query and the document embedding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down **why we do each step** and when this might be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 1: Transforming the Query Embedding**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "updated_query_embedding = torch.matmul(adaptor_matrix, query_embedding)\n",
    "```\n",
    "🔹 **Why?**\n",
    "- The `adaptor_matrix` modifies `query_embedding` before similarity calculation.\n",
    "- This transformation **learns a new representation** of the query that may better align with the document embedding.\n",
    "- It's particularly useful in **transfer learning**, **domain adaptation**, or **fine-tuning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Where is this useful?**\n",
    "- **Cross-domain similarity**: If `query_embedding` and `document_embedding` come from **different distributions** (e.g., different languages, modalities), the `adaptor_matrix` can help bridge the gap.\n",
    "- **Fine-tuning embeddings**: Helps adjust pretrained embeddings to a new dataset.\n",
    "- **Attention mechanisms**: Adapters can function like attention weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 2: Computing Cosine Similarity**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return torch.cosine_similarity(updated_query_embedding, document_embedding, dim=0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "🔹 **Why?**\n",
    "- Cosine similarity measures how **directionally aligned** two vectors are, irrespective of their magnitude.\n",
    "- This is commonly used in **information retrieval**, **semantic similarity tasks**, and **recommendation systems**.\n",
    "- Since we applied `adaptor_matrix`, we check if the transformation improves similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Example Scenario: Query-Document Matching**\n",
    "Imagine a search system where:\n",
    "- The **query_embedding** represents a user’s search.\n",
    "- The **document_embedding** represents a document in the database.\n",
    "- The **adaptor_matrix** helps align the query to the document space.\n",
    "\n",
    "By transforming the query first and then computing similarity, we **increase the likelihood** of retrieving relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Summary**\n",
    "🔹 **Step 1:** `adaptor_matrix` adjusts `query_embedding` → Helps in learning better alignment.  \n",
    "🔹 **Step 2:** Cosine similarity measures relevance between transformed query and document.  \n",
    "🔹 **Use Cases:** **Transfer learning, retrieval systems, domain adaptation, fine-tuning embeddings.**  \n"
